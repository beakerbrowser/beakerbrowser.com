  <h1>Beaker is a more powerful browser, for a more powerful Web.</h1>

  <p class="accent">
    We believe the Web is at its best when it empowers creation and encourages
    participation. That's why we're building a browser for a <em>person-to-person Web</em>.
  </p>

  <h2>Our mission</h2>

  <p>
    The Web enabled communication, collaboration, and creativity at a scale once unimaginable, but it's devolved into a landscape of of isolated platforms that discourage customization and interoperability. The Web's value flows from the people who use it, yet our <a href="https://twitter.com/prozdkp/status/978344325456318465">online experiences</a> are dictated by corporations whose incentives rarely align with our own.
  </p>

  <p>
    We believe the Web can (and must) be a people-first platform, where everybody is invited to create, personalize, and share. We've set out to make it so.
  </p>

  <p>
    We're using <a href="https://datproject.org">peer-to-peer technology</a> to improve creating and sharing on the Web. 
  </p>

  <h3>Why build a browser?</h3>

  <p>
    Browsers are the gateway to the Web! By building a browser with experimental features and capabilities, we have the flexibility to explore how the browser can help uphold the vision of an open Web.

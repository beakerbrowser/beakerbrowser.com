`experimental.globalFetch` is an experimental API for making Ajax calls across origins.

This API is functionally identical to [fetch()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) with the following caveats:

 - [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) is not applied, so the site can send a request to any service
 - A permission prompt is raised for each request to a new origin
 - Only HEAD and GET are supported
 - Cookies/credentials are never sent

For each new origin that the site contacts, a permission prompt will be presented to the user. This makes it possible for `dat://` websites to make cross-origin requests, while the user still has an opportunity to block the requests.

To use this API, include the following in your <a href="/docs/apis/manifest"><code>dat.json</code> manifest file</a>:

```json
{
  "experimental": {
    "apis": ["globalFetch"]
  }
}
```

{% include experimental-api-notice.html %}

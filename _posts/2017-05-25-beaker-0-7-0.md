I'm happy to announce that [Beaker 0.7](https://github.com/beakerbrowser/beaker/releases/tag/0.7.0) is ready to download. You can read the full set of updates in the [release notes](https://github.com/beakerbrowser/beaker/releases/tag/0.7.0). This was a big update with a lot of amazing protocol work by the [Dat project](https://datproject.org).

## New Dat protocol
 
Thanks to the [Dat Project](https://datproject.org), a new version of the Dat protocol has been added to Beaker, with:

 - huge performance gains,
 - file deletion now supported,
 - and versioned URLs.
 
This update was not backwards compatible, so you’ll need to recreate any old Dats in the new version of Beaker.
 
## Upgraded publishing experience

Beaker now makes it extremely easy to create peer-to-peer sites with your preferred editors and build tools. Each site is given a staging folder where you can freely make changes, then publish when ready. Live-reloading is still built in.
 
## Updated docs site

We completely overhauled the docs on [beakerbrowser.com](https://beakerbrowser.com), to include tutorials, information about the Dat protocol, better API docs, and more. Here are some of our favorite pages from the new docs:
 
 - [Tutorial: Create a peer-to-peer blog](https://beakerbrowser.com/docs/tutorials/create-a-blog.html)
 - [Thick applications model](https://beakerbrowser.com/docs/inside-beaker/thick-applications.html)
 - [Why Dat vs. other technologies?](https://beakerbrowser.com/docs/inside-beaker/other-technologies.html)
  
## Major changes:
 
 - Upgraded browser shell UIs, including more clear indicators for when a site is secure/insecure.
 - New dropdown menu with links to your history, bookmarks, library, and more.
 - Better `beaker://library`, with tools for managing your sites, a staging area to review your changes, and a view to monitor network traffic.
 - A new Dat protocol version, which has major performance improvements and a more featured protocol (versions, file deletion).
 - A new [DatArchive Web API](https://beakerbrowser.com/docs/apis/dat.html) for reading and writing Dats from the web.
 - New publishing experience: you now put saved/created dats in folders on your OS, and have a git-like staging area for doing work and publishing.
 - Basic P2P analytics: track the number of peers, and see peer history for the past hour.
 - Native support for [markdown sites](https://beakerbrowser.com/docs/tutorials/create-a-markdown-site.html).
 
## Minor changes

 - More Web Platform support (`window.prompt`, `onbeforeunload`, custom context menus)
 - A “View source” view for Dat sites
 - You can now set a background for your start page in  beaker://settings
 - The error pages for TLS errors more clearly indicate what went wrong
 - Too many bugfixes to count!
 
## Deprecations:
 
 - Deprecated: `bkr` command line tool. With the improved builtin publishing experience, we felt it would be better to reduce the amount of software users need to install and learn.
 - Deprecated: IPFS support. We’ve decided to use Dat exclusively.
 
**NOTE:** This release changed the internal data model of Beaker. Unfortunately that means your old Dats and bookmarks will be lost.

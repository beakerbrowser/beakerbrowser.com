Hey folks! Got a few fresh updates for you today. First, a few handy links:

## Dat DNS

You can now give Dat sites a DNS shortname. You can use the new [dathttpd web server](https://github.com/beakerbrowser/dathttpd) to host your sites from the cloud, and take advantage of this new feature. ([Read the spec here](https://github.com/beakerbrowser/beaker/wiki/Authenticated-Dat-URLs-and-HTTPS-to-Dat-Discovery).)

Some sites to try out:
- [dat://hostless.website](dat://hostless.website)
- [dat://paulfrazee.com](dat://paulfrazee.com)
- [dat://taravancil.com](dat://taravancil.com)
- [dat://www.datprotocol.com](dat://www.datprotocol.com)

## DatHTTPD

The [dathttpd web server](https://github.com/beakerbrowser/dathttpd) lets people visit your site over dat with a DNS shortname in Beaker, and over HTTPS in other browsers. Automatic TLS provision with LetsEncrypt, support for multiple Dat sites and for reverse proxying, and easy-to-setup analytics. Check it out!

## Improved [bkr](https://github.com/beakerbrowser/bkr) command-line

There were too many improvements to list for [bkr](https://github.com/beakerbrowser/bkr), so I'll just show my favorite new command:

``` bash
$ bkr clone dat://paulfrazee.com ./paulfrazee
```

You'll find bkr is now much more usable and intuitive.

## New start page

We split out the builtin views (history, sites library, downloads, and etc) into individual pages, so that your new-tab interface would load faster. Then we put in a _new_ new tab page.

## New docs site

We took a couple minutes to bedazzle our docs site, so [check it out](https://beakerbrowser.com/docs/index.html). You can find a lot more information about Beaker as a whole, plus we've improved our guides for creating sites and hosting.

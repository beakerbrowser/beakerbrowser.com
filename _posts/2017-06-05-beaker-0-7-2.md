## 📝 Self-mutating websites

Beaker now allows applications to modify their own files using the [DatArchive API](https://beakerbrowser.com/docs/apis/dat.html). This enables a model for simple, self-contained web apps such as wikis and todo lists. This decision is part of an [ongoing security discussion](https://github.com/beakerbrowser/beaker/issues/483). We'll blog about this soon.

## 🗑 Dat Garbage Collector

This is something you probably thought Beaker already did. Surprise! We just got around to it.

As you browse Dat sites, you collect a cache of files which stay on your disk so that reloads are fast. The "Garbage Collector" clears out those cache files after 5 days of no access. The collector does not delete files of dats that the user has saved to their library.

## 👆Dat picker API

Thanks to @taravancil we now have an API for selecting an archive from the user's library, using a modal dialog. Think of this like the file-picker, for Dat archives. It includes the ability to create a new archive, if the user chooses.

Example usecase: a text editor would use this API to prompt the user for the Dat they want to edit.

```js
var archive = await DatArchive.selectArchive({
  title: "Select an archive",
  buttonLabel: "Submit",
  filters: {writable: true}
})
```

## How to install

If you already have Beaker installed on OSX, you can use the auto-updater to get latest. **However, [due to a bug in Beaker 0.7](https://twitter.com/BeakerBrowser/status/869230831935606785), you will need to use the settings page.**
